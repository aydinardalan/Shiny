# Shiny

The goal of Shiny is to build a web application using the R programming
language.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aydinardalan/Lab5")
#> Skipping install of 'Lab5' from a github remote, the SHA1 (6a1f64e2) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

R command to run the shiny app:

``` r
